<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.HTML is the most basic building block of the Web.It defines the meaning and structure of web content
    HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.HTML provides many tags.An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.
	So,At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document</p>
